## 👔 For Church Leaders

### Viewing Leadership Prayers

1. Access the **"Leadership"** tab (only visible to admins)
2. See all private and leadership-only prayers
3. Pray strategically for your flock
4. Reach out personally when needed

### Why Leadership Prayers Matter

**Scenario**: A member struggling with deep depression might not want the whole church to know, but desperately needs pastoral prayer.

**Solution**: Leadership-only prayers ensure:
- ✅ Confidential matters stay confidential
- ✅ Pastors know where to shepherd
- ✅ Members feel safe to be vulnerable
- ✅ Real care happens, not just public appearances

### Best Practices for Leaders

**Do:**
- ✅ Review leadership prayers daily
- ✅ Follow up personally (call/visit)
- ✅ Encourage public sharing when appropriate
- ✅ Celebrate answered prayers from the pulpit
- ✅ Use insights to shape sermons (without breaking confidence)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Share leadership prayers publicly
- ❌ Ignore urgent flags
- ❌ Make assumptions - ask the person
- ❌ Let prayers go "cold" without follow-up

## 📊 Privacy Levels Explained

## 📈 Why This Matters

### Biblical Foundation
**Philippians 4:6** - Prayer is our response to anxiety
**James 5:16** - "Pray for each other"
**1 Peter 5:7** - "Cast all your anxiety on him"
**Matthew 18:19-20** - "Where two or three gather in my name"

### Practical Impact
1. **Real Care**: Members feel seen beyond Sunday
2. **Burden Sharing**: "Carry each other's burdens" (Galatians 6:2)
3. **Faith Building**: Answered prayers build corporate faith
4. **Pastor Insight**: Leaders know where the flock hurts
5. **Daily Connection**: Church isn't a weekly event, it's daily family

### The "Monday Crisis"
**Problem**: Most people have their biggest struggles on Monday-Saturday, not Sunday.

**Solution**: Prayer Wall means:
- Tuesday job crisis? Church is there.
- Wednesday health scare? Prayers go up.
- Friday family fight? Leadership is aware.

**Result**: Church beyond Sunday. ShepherdCare in action.
